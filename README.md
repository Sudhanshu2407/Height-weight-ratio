# Height-weight-ratio
Here we calculate the weight of person on the basis of their height

# Project Overview

The Height and Weight Ratio Prediction project aims to explore and predict the relationship between an individual's height and weight. This project 

utilizes various machine learning models to accurately predict an individual's weight based on their height, demonstrating the application of regression 

techniques in health-related data analysis.

Dataset


# The dataset used in this project includes the following features:

Height (in centimeters)

Weight (in kilograms)


The dataset provides a comprehensive view of the height and weight of individuals, which helps in understanding the relationship between these two 
variables.

# You will see the login page where you can enter your credentials. The default credentials are:

Username: admin
Password: 123

You can also sign up with a new username and password. The credentials will be saved and used for subsequent logins.

Once logged in, you will be redirected to the prediction page where you can input the height to predict the weight.

The model will predict the weight based on the input height and display the result.

# Models Used

The project explores multiple machine learning models to predict weight based on height:

Linear Regression

Polynomial Regression

Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Among these, the Random Forest Regressor was found to be the most accurate model with the highest prediction accuracy.

# Results

The Random Forest Regressor model provided the best results for predicting weight based on height.

# Visualization

The project includes several visualizations to understand the distribution and relationships within the data:


Scatter plots for the relationship between height and weight

Regression line plots to show model predictions

# Future Work

Implementing more advanced machine learning models and techniques such as Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, or neural networks.

Incorporating additional features such as age, gender, and BMI to improve model accuracy.

Enhancing the user interface for better user experience.

Implementing user authentication with more robust security measures.
